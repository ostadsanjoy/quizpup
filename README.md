# QuizPup

QuizPup is a full-stack study platform for JEE, NEET, and CAT aspirants. It combines AI-generated quizzes, preloaded flashcard decks, and an OCR-powered notes digitizer into a single Flask web app that also ships as a native Android app via Capacitor.

**Live app:** [quizpup.onrender.com](https://quizpup.onrender.com/)

## Features

### AI Quiz Engine
- Generates 10–200 question multiple-choice quizzes on any topic, or from an uploaded PDF (text is extracted and used as source material).
- Four difficulty levels — easy, medium, hard, and **god mode** (university-level rigor, higher generation temperature, escalated to a heavier model).
- Hints according to the difficulty level of the quiz: unlimited on easy, ~30% of question count on medium, none on hard/god mode.
- Large quizzes are split into batches and generated concurrently against the Gemini API, then merged.
- Every question ships with a hint and a post-attempt explanation; sessions and answers are persisted so a quiz can be reviewed after submission.

### Flashcards
- **Preloaded decks**: ~600+ hand-curated cards organized as Exam → Subject → Chapter (JEE: Physics/Chemistry/Maths, NEET: Biology/Chemistry/Physics, CAT: Quant/DILR/VARC).
- **AI-generated decks**: type any topic and get 15–25 revision flashcards, saved to your account for later review.

### SuperNotes (OCR + Summarization)
- Upload a photo or PDF of handwritten/printed notes.
- PDFs are text-extracted first; if the page text density is too low (i.e. scanned/handwritten), the app falls back to Gemini-based OCR.
- Long notes are split into segments and summarized concurrently, then reassembled into a structured HTML summary and a downloadable two-column PDF (built with fpdf2 and DejaVu fonts for full Unicode support).
- Processing runs as a background thread so the upload request returns immediately; the frontend polls a status endpoint.

### Accounts & Security
- Email/password auth (Flask-Login) with OTP-based email verification, password reset, and email-change flows — all backed by rate-limited attempt counters.
- Transactional email delivered via the Brevo HTTP API.
- CSRF protection (Flask-WTF), hardened session cookies (HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, Secure in production), and signed, expiring tokens for note PDF downloads.
- Ownership checks on every quiz/flashcard/notes endpoint so users can only access their own data.

### Android App
- Packaged as a native Android app using Capacitor, pointing at the live Render deployment (`www` dir + `capacitor.config.json`).

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login, Flask-WTF |
| Database | PostgreSQL (via Supabase) in production, SQLite fallback for local dev |
| AI | Google Gemini API (`google-genai`) — tiered between a lite and a heavier model based on task difficulty/size |
| PDF handling | pypdf (extraction), fpdf2 (generation) |
| Email | Brevo HTTP API |
| Mobile | Capacitor (Android) |
| Deployment | Render, served with Gunicorn |

## Setup

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   npm install   # only needed for the Capacitor/Android build
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with:
   ```
   SECRET_KEY=
   DATABASE_URL=            # Postgres URL; omit to fall back to local SQLite
   SUPABASE_URL=
   SUPABASE_KEY=
   GEMINI_API_KEY=
   BREVO_API_KEY=
   BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL=
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Tables are created and auto-migrated (missing columns are added) on startup.
